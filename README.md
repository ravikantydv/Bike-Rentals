# Bike-Rentals

## Problem Statement
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.. We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, statsmodels, sklearn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Problem Solving Methodology
* Data Understanding-
> Understanding and working with data dictionary and getting good knowledge of all the columns and their domain specific uses.
* Data Cleaning-
> Removing null valued columns, single uniques columns, unnecessary columns then manipulation of data such as conversion of data types, removing outliers, deriving new variables and many more.
* Analysing data.
> Analysing the categorical and numerical variables
* Model
> Fitting the model and then Evaluating it
